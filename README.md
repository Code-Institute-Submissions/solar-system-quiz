# Solar System Quiz - Practical Python Milestone Project

This is my Milestone Project for the Practical Python module of the Full Stack Development Course. This site has been developed to give the user a basic understanding of the solar system. They can also test their knowledge by taking the quiz and compare their performance against other users.

The site uses the same background images throughout the site, creating a consistent feel and user experience. The Solar System Info page contains information that may be of interest to the user and uses images and an interactive style that the user will find visually appealing.

## User Experience

Before beginning the build of the site, I created wireframes to help with the design. These can be found in the following link: https://github.com/JShad30/solar-system-quiz/tree/master/wireframes

### Example uses of site

I have aimed to make this site easy to use and self explanatory in how to use it. The front page is simple with just a site overview, and an introduction to the two main following pages, the 'Solar System Info' page and the 'Take Quiz' page.

While on the site the user will have access to the social media links displayed in the footer on every page. They can also revert to the home page by clicking the 'Solar System' logo displayed at the top of every page. However, where necessary there are also return home buttons throughout the site.

#### Home Page

The homepage of this site contains an introduction to the sections of the site, and two links: First to the 'Solar System Info' page and the second to the 'Take Quiz' page.

#### Solar Info Page

For those interested to learn more about the solar system, they can click on the Solar System Info button. This provides information about the subject, and images of the objects are displayed. Each object has a brief overview, which can be expanded to show more information should the user click the 'More Info' button. At the end of this page there is a direct link to the quiz.

#### Take Quiz

The 'Take Quiz' page can be linked to from the home page or from the bottom of the 'Solar System Info' page. 

When on this page, the user is asked to provide a firstname, lastname and username. When the submit button is selected they are taken to a message, which introduces them to the quiz and a button to take them to the first question.

#### Questions

Each question is displayed individually and needs to be answered. Once an answer is submitted the quiz then moves onto the next question. Once all questions have been answered the user can click the 'Submit' button. They will then be taken through to the quiz completed section.

#### Quiz Completed

A message is displayed to the user which varies depending on the score achieved in the quiz. If the user has achieved a high score, the message will be congratulatory, and a lower score will persuade the user to visit the 'Solar System Info' page. In all cases, the user will also find a link through to the 'leaderboard' page.

#### Leaderboard

If the user clicks on this link, they will be able to see the usernames and the scores of the previous users. They will be able to search the list and see where they stand. This page also carries a link back to the solar system info where they can learn more or choose to go back to the home page.

## Features

### Form 

When the user clicks on this button, they are taken to a page with a form which asks them to provide their first name, last name and a username. This is run through the 'solar-quiz.html' page. When the form is filled out, the first name, last name and the username is stored in the 'names.json' file. These are called on later in the following pages.

### Questions

They are then taken to the quiz questions and answer each of the questions. All questions need to be answered as the radio buttons are set as 'required'. The quiz pages are implemented through the templates, solar-quiz.html, solar-quiz-user.html, questions.html, quiz-completed.html. When filling out the information on the solar-quiz page, the user initialises a cookie that is then stored for the rest of the quiz.

### Quiz completed message

The message is displayed using Python logic in 'run.pyâ€™ and displayed using the 'quiz-complete.html'. The flashed message displayed depends on the score the player has acheived. 

### Leaderboard

The leaderboard is presented on the 'leaderboard.html' page and its route is /solar_quiz/leaderboard. The leaderboard is there for players to compare their performance against other players.

### Extra Features that could be added

I would in the future consider adding a feature where when the form is completed it does a check for the existing usernames. If there is a clash the user would be asked for a different username.

More questions could be added to the questions.json file, from which twenty questions would be selected at random. This would keep the quiz fresh for a user that wanted another attempt.

## Technology Used

This project was built using different languages, libraries and frameworks. 

### Python

The site has been built using the Python based Flask framework (http://flask.pocoo.org/) and is run from the 'run.py' file. All the pages are routed from here, and contain the logic required for the quiz. Python has been used to create the logic within the 'run.py' file (https://www.python.org/). The 'jinja template engine' (http://jinja.pocoo.org/) has been used within the template pages.

### Frontend

The template pages have been written with HTML5 (http://www.html5.com/) and styled with CSS3 (www.css3.com) in the style.css file. CSS3 was used to create the mobile responsiveness seen across the whole site. It has also been used to create the hover effects for the buttons and the social icons. On each of the pages, you will find the jinja template engine used. A 'base.html' page has been created to contain the HTML code that is to be used on each of the pages i.e. the head, header and the footer.

On the 'Solar System Info' page jQuery (https://jquery.com/) has been used to reveal the extra information if the user clicks on the 'More Info' button. When one of these buttons is selected, a 'slideToggle' instruction is used. The other solar objects information has a 'slideUp' instruction placed on it. This means that only one object will have its information revealed at any one time. jQuery is also used in the navbar which changes from transparent to black when the user scrolls down the page.

### Data Storage

The data for the questions asked in the quiz and the information contained on the 'Solar System Info' page (https://json.org/) are stored in their own json files. The information collected from the from, i.e. username, firstname, lastname, and score are stored in a .txt file as a dictionary, and this is read as a json file in the leaderboard page. 

### Version Control

Git was used throughout the project for version control. I also used the 'File Revision History' to revert when there was experimentation with different design techniques.

## Testing

The CSS was run through a CSS validator and errors were corrected. It now shows no errors. The javascript/jquery code was validated using jshint and showed no errors.

The site has been tested manually by clicking the links to the pages and checking all of the jQuery options. It has also been tested in different browsers.

The quiz has been completed many times in order to check scores calculate correctly.

## Issues While Building the Project

When a username, first name and last name are filled out in the form a session cookie is initialised. This then is carried throughout the quiz to the quiz-completed page. I noticed that the session cookie remained open at this point. Therefore, if the user clicked the back arrow in their browser it would return to the last question (or further depending how many times the back arrow was clicked). They could then submit the answer again which would add to their score increasing. This was eliminated after a discussion with my mentor that can be seen in lines 64-70 of the run.py file, which redirects the user to the current question.

I have tried different methods of storing the data regarding the username, firstname and lastname of the users. The current site has them stored in a dictionary file and then they are read as a json file in the run.py file.

## Deployment

This project has been deployed to both Github and Heroku, by using the push command in the terminal.

The files on Github can be found via https://github.com/JShad30/solar-system-quiz, and the website can be viewed via https://solar-system-quiz.herokuapp.com/.

The basis of the information was taken from various websites primarily wikipedia, but information was also obtained from the official NASA website and solarviews.com.

I had assistance from tutor support and the mentor on some of the areas of the project when I had difficulties as specified earlier.
