# UK Property Stats - Solar System Quiz

This is my Milestone Project for the Practical Python part of the Full Stack Development Course. This site has been developed to give the user a basic understanding of the solar system. They can then test their knowledge by taking the quiz, and compare their performance with those of other users.

The site has the same background images throughout the site, creating a consistent feel and user experience. The Solar Info page contains information that may be of interest to the user and uses images and an iteractive style that the user will find visually appealing.

## User Experience

Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.


In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.




The homepage of this site contains an overview to introduce the user, and two links: First to the 'Solar System Info' page and the second to the 'Take Quiz' page.

For those interested to learn more about the solar system, they can click on the solar info page. This displays information about the subject, and images of the objects are displayed through the page. Each object has a brief overview, which can be expanded to show more information if the user clicks the 'More Info' button. At the end of this page there is a link direct to the quiz.



## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

## Technology Used

This project was built using different languages, libraries and frameworks. 

The site has been built using the Python based Flask framework, the official site can be found at http://flask.pocoo.org/, and is run from the 'run.py' file. All the pages are routed from here, and contain the logic required for the quiz. 

On each of the pages, you will find the jinja template engine used. A 'base.html' page has been created to contain the HTML code that is to be used on each of the 

HTML5



CSS3

jQuery

Python

The data for the questions asked in the quiz, the information contained on the 'Solar Info' page, and the names gathered in the form when starting the quiz are contained in their own individual json files.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
